# TheMaze
This android application is the implementation of Maze solver using backtracking algorithm.
User creates the maze and press start solving button to solve.
The AI(Maze solver) start solving the maze from red block (Starting position) to find green block (Goal position).

************************************************
This project is buit with Android Studio 1.5.1
Minimum SDK version  15
Targeted SDK version 23

HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT

- Download the TheMaze.zip (Unzip it to the desire location)
- Open Android Studio
- Click on File -> import -> "Target the loacation of the project" and import the project
- Now simply Run the project or press (shift -F10) to launch the app
*****************************************************************************************

Future Goals
 - Modify AI (Maze solver) to use BFS (breadth first search) and DFS (depth first search) along with different heuristics to solve the maze.
 - Include difficulty level option to create more complex grid (for exmple 80 X 80 grid)
